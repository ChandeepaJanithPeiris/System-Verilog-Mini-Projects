# System-Verilog-Mini-Projects
This repository includes Mini projects that I have done using System Verilog
## 1. FIR Filter Design  
This is a System-Verilog implementation of a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter. This filter is designed to smooth out a signal by averaging over a specified number of samples.
## 2. Booth Multiplication Algorithm Implementation
This is a implementation of a Booth Multiplier using System-Verilog and simulates the design using Xilinx Vivado.
